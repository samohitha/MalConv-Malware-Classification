# DSCI6015-Midterm-MalConv-Malware-Classification

## Project Introduction
Welcome to the DSCI6015 SP24 Midterm Project - Cloud-based PE Malware Detection API. This project is a significant milestone in the domain of Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity, undertaken as part of the Spring 2024 semester at the University of New Haven, under the guidance of Professor Vahid Behzadan.

## Project Objectives
The primary aim of this project is to design and deploy a machine learning model capable of classifying Portable Executable (PE) files as either malicious or benign. Leveraging the MalConv architecture, the model will undergo rigorous training on the EMBER-2018 v2 dataset.

## Project Tasks

### Task 1 – Model Development and Training
In this initial phase, a robust deep neural network inspired by the MalConv architecture will be constructed using Python 3.10 and PyTorch (version 2.x). While drawing insights from existing implementations within the EMBER repository, custom modifications will be made to align with the project's specific requirements. The entire process will be meticulously documented in a Jupyter Notebook, ensuring transparency and reproducibility. To expedite training, cloud platforms like Google Colab or AWS Sagemaker will be utilized.

### Task 2 - Deployment of Cloud API
Upon successful model training, the focus will shift towards deploying the trained model as a cloud-based API using Amazon Sagemaker. This pivotal step enables seamless integration with other applications, empowering real-time malware classification capabilities.

### Task 3 – Development of Web Client
The final phase involves the creation of an intuitive web application using Streamlit. End-users will have the convenience of uploading PE files directly to the application. The uploaded files will undergo transformation into feature vectors compatible with the MalConv/EMBER model. Subsequently, these feature vectors will be transmitted to the deployed API, and the classification results (Malware or Benign) will be promptly presented to the user.
